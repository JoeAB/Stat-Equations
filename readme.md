Just a simple project I'm working on in C# as I also study for Stat class.

The overall goal is to create calculators to solve the various problems given throughout the course.

So far I have methods for mean, median, percentiles, different forms of counting, and standard deviation.

I will add more over time and hope to add a user interface after writing code for every equation.
